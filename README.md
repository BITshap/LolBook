This is an App I built for League of Legends Players looking to improve

I was a grandmaster Bard main and used these same strategies to get better with every game - I think NA needs more systematic training.

These are similar training patterns they use in korea, give it a shot!

//goals for app:

A calender and a database - so players can track their progress and score (also input box for 1 thing they learned after every game and that text being aviablable to players in one location)
